shift_register.h and shift_register.cc are the shift register class files.
they compile now
shift_register_unit_test.h attempts to set up the cppunit framework so 
we can do a unit test for this class.

shift_register_TestRunner.cc is where the unit test is ??? not sure what
the hell it is supposed to be doing. Maybe setting up the test that I 
thought was est up with shift_register_unit_test. 

The test runner framework is above the unit test stuff in cppunit.
There is also fixtures, which is in between unit tests and test runners.
